A guide dedicated for trying to troubleshoot Cultivation.

## Unable to play on `localhost`.
Make sure your server is running with **encryption disabled**.\
Additionally, make sure Cultivation **is not using HTTPS**.

You probably didn't close Cultivation properly.\
Go to your *Windows Settings*, then *Network*, then *Proxy*, then disable it.
